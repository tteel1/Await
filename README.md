Submit: Async/Await Practice
Requirements
Write an asynchronous function and call it with async/await
Write function called getRandomNumber that returns a promise
In the promise, write a setTimeout() that will resolve the promise with a random number after .5 seconds
Write an async function that invokes the getRandomNumber function, awaiting the random number, and printing that to the console.
Invoke your async function
Fetch remote data using async/await
Write an asynchronous function that accepts 1 parameter
A city name
When invoked, this function should use geocode.xyz's API retrieve the city data, which uses a URL formatted as follows:

https://geocode.xyz/seattle?json=1

Once retrieved, print to the console the latitude and longitude
Invoke your async function with a few cities as a test
(Note: the API will only allow you 2 calls per second, so if you are getting errors and you think you shouldn't be, try calling fetching only ONCE per execution.)

Then, within your group, please take turns sharing your work. Provide feedback to your teammates on ways to improve what has already been written. 

Submit a link to a GitHub repo containing your code.
